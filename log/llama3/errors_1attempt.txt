Prediction List: ['4']

Prediction: 4

Ground Truth: If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

Ground Truth: The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

Ground Truth: In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.

Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800
Since a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.

Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8

Ground Truth: Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.
The pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.
If you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.
The pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.
All the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds

Ground Truth: The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

Ground Truth: First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.

Ground Truth: First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats
Next, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes
We know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10
Now we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10
We add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12
Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3

Then divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days
Then divide the number of days by the number of days per week to convert the answer to weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks

Ground Truth: Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 miles.
Aaron took 16 minutes, so he ran each mile in 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 minutes.
Vanessa takes twice as long to run a mile, so she took 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 minutes for each mile.
She ran 4 miles, so she took 4 * 16 = <<4*16=64>>64 minutes to complete her part of the race.
