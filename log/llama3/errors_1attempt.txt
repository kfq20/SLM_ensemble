Ground Truth: The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000

Prediction: 128

Ground Truth: The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

Ground Truth: First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB
Then divide that number by the download rate to find the time until Windows restarts: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes
Then find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes
Then add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes

In half an hour he goes 30*.5=<<30*.5=15>>15 miles
He then drives another 2-.5=<<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 hours
In that time he goes 80*1.5=<<80*1.5=120>>120 miles
So he drove 120+15=<<120+15=135>>135 miles

In the third month, the number of downloads of the program reduced by 30/100*180 = <<30/100*180=54>>54
There were 180-54 = <<180-54=126>>126 downloads in the third month.
In the three months, the total number of downloads of the program was 126+240 = <<126+240=366>>366

There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Then find the total amount Jill makes per week coaching: $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $<<30*15=450>>450/week
Then add those two amounts to find the total amount Jill makes per week: $700/week + $450/week = $<<700+450=1150>>1150/week
Then multiply that number by the number of weeks Jill works in a year to find her annual salary: $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $<<1150*50=57500>>57,500

Ground Truth: First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours
Next subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour
Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph

So for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.
So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.

Prediction List: ['72']

Prediction: 72

Ground Truth: If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

Ground Truth: If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams

Ground Truth: 1 pound of beeswax and the wick make 10 candles and he wants to make 20 candles so he needs 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 pounds of beeswax
1 pound of beeswax costs $10.00 and he needs 2 pounds so his supplies will cost 10*2 = $<<10*2=20.00>>20.00
He wants to sell each candle for $2.00 each and he's selling 20 candles so that's 2*20 = $<<2*20=40.00>>40.00
If he makes $40.00 selling candles and his supplies cost $20.00 then his net profit is 40-20 = $<<40-20=20.00>>20.00

Ground Truth: He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties
So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties

The number of days left in the year is 365 - 180 = <<365-180=185>>185
The number of cups of dog food given for the rest of the first year is 185 * 2 = <<185*2=370>>370 cups
The total number of cups given in the first year is 180 + 370 = <<180+370=550>>550 cups
The number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = <<550/110=5>>5 bags

Ground Truth: Find how many packages of 3 would be needed which is 18 Ã· 3 = <<18/3=6>>6.
The cost of using packages of 3 is 6 Ã— $2.50 = $<<6*2.5=15>>15.
Find how many packages of 2 would be needed which is 18 Ã· 2 = <<18/2=9>>9.
The cost of using packages of 2 is 9 Ã— $1 = $<<9*1=9>>9.
Vincent would save $15 - $9 = $<<15-9=6>>6.

Ground Truth: Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.
So the two girls got a total of 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 liters.
Thus, a total of 8 + 6 = <<8+6=14>>14 liters of water were gotten by the two girls and the boy.
Therefore, 24 - 14 = <<24-14=10>>10 liters of water were left.

Ground Truth: Gene has been on 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years of vacations, so he has 11 rows of blocks.
He goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has been on 4 * 11 = <<4*11=44>>44 vacations.
Gene has 1 shirt from each vacation, so he has 44 * 1 = <<44*1=44>>44 quilt blocks in all.

Ground Truth: In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.
Sylvie earnings will increase by 10/100 * $7200/year = $<<10/100*7200=720>>720/year after 5 years.
In three years, the total increase in her salary will be 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160
After three years, Sylvie will be paid $7200 + $2160 = $<<7200+2160=9360>>9360

Ground Truth: Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000
Combining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000
Dividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000
