At the end, you MUST write the answer as an integer after '####'."}]

Response: Step 1: Calculate the increase in the house's value.
The house was bought for $80,000 and increased in value by 150%. 

Increase in value = 150% of $80,000
Increase in value = 1.5 * $80,000
Increase in value = $120,000

Step 2: Calculate the selling price of the house.
Selling price = Cost + Increase in value
Selling price = $80,000 + $120,000
Selling price = $200,000

Step 3: Calculate the profit Josh made.
Profit = Selling price - Cost
Profit = $200,000 - $80,000
Profit = $120,000

#### 120,000

Ground Truth: The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000
#### 70000

Response: Step 1: Calculate the total cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
15 cups (morning) + 25 cups (afternoon) = 40 cups

Step 2: Calculate the total cups of feed needed for the final meal.
The total number of chickens is 20.
So, the total cups of feed needed for the final meal is 20 x 3 = 60 cups.

Step 3: Add the cups of feed needed for the final meal to the cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
Total cups of feed = 40 cups (morning and afternoon) + 60 cups (final meal) = 100 cups

#### 100

Ground Truth: If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.
