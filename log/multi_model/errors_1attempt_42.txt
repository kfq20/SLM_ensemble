Ground Truth: The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

Prediction: 100

Ground Truth: If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.

In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.

Ground Truth: Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.
Each week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.
Each week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.
The bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.

She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920
Blake won because 3000 > 2920
The winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80

Ground Truth: Locsin caught 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 starfishes.
They caught 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 starfishes.
Locsin caught 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 seahorses
They caught 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 seahorses
Locsin caught 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 clownfish.
So, they caught 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 clownfish.
Therefore, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 15 + 9 + 8 = <<15+9+8=32>>32 fish.

Ground Truth: When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4
If the price increases after every two months, in 36 months, it will increase 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 times.
If each increase is $4, the total amount the price of the bag of marbles will have increased by after 36 months is 18*$4 = $<<18*4=72>>72
After the total increase of the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, the total cost will be $20+$72 = $<<20+72=92>>92

Ground Truth: If Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, same as Sally four, their total age 8+8 = <<8+8=16>>16 years.
Granny red is two times as old as Sally four, meaning Granny red is 2*8 = <<2*8=16>>16 years old.
Sally Thirtytwo, Sally four, and Sally red are 16+16 = <<32=32>>32 years old.
Sally two is three years older than Granny red, meaning Sally two is 16+3= <<16+3=19>>19 years old.
The four birds have a total age of 32+19 = <<32+19=51>>51 years old.

Prediction: 60

Ground Truth: There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.
Billy only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.
So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.
