Question: In 2004, there were 60 kids at a cookout. In 2005, half the number of kids came to the cookout as compared to 2004. In 2006, 2/3 as many kids came to the cookout as in 2005. How many kids came to the cookout in 2006?  
Let's break down the problem and suggest every step to compute, without giving the specific calculation procedure

Frist, Calculate the number of kids in 2005: Take half of the number of kids from 2004.  
Then Calculate the number of kids in 2006: Take 2/3 of the number of kids from 2005.


Question: Zilla spent 7% of her monthly earnings on rent, half of it on her other monthly expenses, and put the rest in her savings. If she spent $133 on her rent, how much does she deposit into her savings account in a month?
Let's break down the problem and suggest every step to compute, without giving the specific calculation procedure

Frist, Find Zilla’s total monthly earnings: Use the fact that $133 is 7% of her earnings.  
Then Determine the amount spent on other expenses: This is half of her total monthly earnings.  
Then Calculate her savings: Subtract the amounts spent on rent and other expenses from her total monthly earnings.


Question: If Buzz bought a pizza with 78 slices at a restaurant and then decided to share it with the waiter in the ratio of 5:8, with Buzz's ratio being 5, what's twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate?
Let's break down the problem and suggest every step to compute, without giving the specific calculation procedure

Frist, Determine the total ratio: Add the ratio values for Buzz and the waiter 5 + 8 = 13.  
Then Calculate the size of one part: Divide the total number of slices by the total ratio to find the number of slices each part represents.  
Then Calculate the waiter’s share: Multiply the size of one part by the waiter’s ratio.  
Finally Subtract 20 from the waiter’s share: This gives the final result.


Question: Mr. Gardner bakes 20 cookies, 25 cupcakes, and 35 brownies for his second-grade class of 20 students. If he wants to give each student an equal amount of sweet treats, how many sweet treats will each student receive?
Let's break down the problem and suggest every step to compute, without giving the specific calculation procedure

Frist, Calculate the total number of sweet treats: Add the number of cookies, cupcakes, and brownies baked.  
Then, Divide the total number of sweet treats by the number of students: This gives the number of sweet treats each student will receive.  
Finally Ensure the distribution is equal: Verify the total is divisible evenly among the students.
