Question: In 2004, there were 60 kids at a cookout. In 2005, half the number of kids came to the cookout as compared to 2004. In 2006, 2/3 as many kids came to the cookout as in 2005. How many kids came to the cookout in 2006?  
Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the question:
Frist, Calculate the number of kids in 2005: Take half of the number of kids from 2004.  
Then Calculate the number of kids in 2006: Take 2/3 of the number of kids from 2005.
Now Let's calculate step by step

In 2005, 60/2=30 kids came to the cookout.
In 2006, 30/3*2=20 kids came to the cookout.
The answer is 20


Question: Zilla spent 7% of her monthly earnings on rent, half of it on her other monthly expenses, and put the rest in her savings. If she spent $133 on her rent, how much does she deposit into her savings account in a month?
Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the question:
Frist, Find Zilla’s total monthly earnings: Use the fact that $133 is 7% of her earnings.  
Then Determine the amount spent on other expenses: This is half of her total monthly earnings.  
Then Calculate her savings: Subtract the amounts spent on rent and other expenses from her total monthly earnings.
Now Let's calculate step by step

Since $133 is equal to 7% of her earnings, then 1% is equal to $133/7 = $19.
The total monthly earning of Zilla is represented by 100%, so $19 x 100 = $1900 is her monthly earnings.
So, $1900/2 = $950 is spent on her other monthly expenses.
The total amount spent on the rent and other monthly expenses is $133 + $950 = $1083.
Hence, she saves $1900 - $1083 = $817 per month.
The answer is 817


Question: If Buzz bought a pizza with 78 slices at a restaurant and then decided to share it with the waiter in the ratio of 5:8, with Buzz's ratio being 5, what's twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate?
Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the question:
Frist, Determine the total ratio: Add the ratio values for Buzz and the waiter 5 + 8 = 13.  
Then Calculate the size of one part: Divide the total number of slices by the total ratio to find the number of slices each part represents.  
Then Calculate the waiter’s share: Multiply the size of one part by the waiter’s ratio.  
Finally Subtract 20 from the waiter’s share: This gives the final result.
Now Let's calculate step by step

The total ratio representing the slices of pizza that Buzz bought is 5+8=13
If he shared the slices of pizza with the waiter, the waiter received a fraction of 8/13 of the total number of slices, which totals 8/13 * 78 = 48 slices
Twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate is 48-20 = 28
The answer is 28
